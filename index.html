					<h2>About me</h2>
					<hr>

					<h3>Some background</h3>
					<p> Started coding in WDI not long ago and have come quite a long way since.
						  Never knew web development was so easy, not in a sense that it requires no effort.</p>
					<p> This course in its short time has taught me how to work HTML and CSS as well as Javascript to manipulate the output of HTML so that changes can be made easier at any point without affecting the layout</p>
					<p> Of course though as I mentioned above, it being easy was also due to the fact that for the most part, all of my time spent since the beginning have been dedicated to trying to improve and expand my knowledge in this area</p>
